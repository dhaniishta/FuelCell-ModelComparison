# **FuelCell-Performance-Predictor**

**FuelCell-Performance-Predictor** is a machine learning model comparison designed to analyze and predict the performance of fuel cells using various regression models. This project evaluates the efficiency of multiple models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression, to determine the best predictor for the dataset.
